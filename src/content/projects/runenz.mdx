# Hey, that's right here!

I've been a long-time tinkerer with the web. All the way back in middle school, I was editing HTML on my little chromebook. At some point, I added [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) to make styling a little easier, but it was still a lot of manual work.

I eventually picked up [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for its ability to do anything you were able to coerce React and Webpack into doing. While it was powerful, it never felt _nice_ to use. Cue me switching between half a dozen frameworks in the span of a couple years. I landed on [Solid Start](https://start.solidjs.com/) for a good while because it felt like Next but a little cleaner and more streamlined. But this website is still first a foremost a static blog, which is why [**Astro**](https://astro.build/) is so appealing. I still get my nice styling -now with [UnoCSS](https://unocss.dev)- and composability with solid.js, but _only when I need it_.

All the posts you see here are generated from plain markdown with minimal work. I'm hoping to add some more interesting stuff later, but for now Astro provides a very nice starting point.
